# Portfolio Website
Personal Portfolio Website using Three.js and React

This is a personal portfolio website built with Vite, React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. The site showcases various sections, including a hero banner, about me, projects, testimonials, work experience, and a contact form. It is a work in progress, and more features and refinements are planned. It's a good learning project to pick up Threejs.

## Features
1. Hero Section

A visually captivating introduction with 3D elements powered by Three.js and React Three Fiber.

2. About Section

Provides a brief overview of my background, skills, and interests.

3. Projects Section

Highlights my notable projects with descriptions and links to live demos or repositories.

4. Testimonials Section

Showcases feedback from colleagues, mentors, or clients.

5. Work Experience Section

6. Contact Form

## Getting Started
If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:  `git clone https://github.com/fxsegura/fxsegura-portfolio.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. For email functionality in the contact form, we use EmailJs. You can create an EmailJs account and connect your email. Then, create a .env file and add the following keys:
```
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=, 
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=,
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=,
```
4. Run `npm run dev` to get the local server up and running at localhost:5173

#

## Future enhancements
Going forward I'd like to play around more with the 3d models, or ideally make my own custom ones. The models used in the project are freely accessible online. Furthermore I'd like to add more animations and personal projects that are also a work in progress and aren't live yet.


Thanks for checking out my project!
